 Notes on Apache Thrift and Google Protocol Buffer in MINA 3.0
 =============================================================
 
 Both Thrift and Protobuf need a specific executable files to generate the 
 required Java code.
 
 Both modules doesn't have any dependency against code generated by these
 executable files, but the dedicated unit tests have dependencies against
 them.
 
 Not having the appropriate version of Apache Thrift or Google Protocol
 Buffer should not prevent developers/users to build MINA 3.0. For this
 particular reason, the generated files are also stored on the
 repository.
 
 The generation scripts are stored in both directories under the name 
 "prepare.sh".
